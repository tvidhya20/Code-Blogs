TOLOWERCASE..

The "To Lower Case" operation is a text transformation that converts all uppercase letters in a given string to their corresponding lowercase counterparts. In other words, it changes the capital letters to small letters.

--> If a string contains any uppercase letters, applying "To Lower Case" converts those uppercase letters to lowercase.

--> If the string already consists of all lowercase letters, the operation has no effect on those characters.

--> For instance, applying "To Lower Case" to the string "Hello World" would transform it to "hello world".

--> This operation is commonly used when you want to perform case-insensitive comparisons, normalize text, or ensure consistency in letter casing.
