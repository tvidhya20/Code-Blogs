DETECTING CYCLE IN A GRAPH.....

Decrypting a cycle in a graph involves understanding how to identify and interpret cycles within the graph structure. A cycle in a graph is a closed path where the start and end vertices are the same, and it passes through distinct vertices without revisiting any vertex (except for the starting and ending vertex).

Process of decrypting a cycle in a graph:

--> The graph is typically represented as a collection of vertices and edges. It could be represented using an adjacency matrix, adjacency list, or an edge list.
--> One common approach to detecting cycles in a graph is using Depth-First Search (DFS). During the DFS traversal, you keep track of visited vertices and detect back edges.
--> In an undirected graph, a back edge is an edge that connects a vertex to one of its ancestors in the DFS traversal. In a directed graph, a back edge is an edge that points back to a previously visited vertex.
--> As you traverse the graph using DFS, if you encounter an edge leading to a vertex that has already been visited and is not the parent of the current vertex (for directed graphs), or is not the immediate neighbor (for undirected graphs), then you've found a cycle.
--> Once you have detected a cycle, decrypting it involves extracting information from the cycle. This could be the vertices involved in the cycle, the order in which they appear, or any additional information associated with the edges.
