MULTISTRINGSEARCH...


Imagine you have a bunch of words and you want to find out if each of these words exists in a given text or document. That's where multi-string search comes in.

Steps in Multi-String Search:

--> You start with a list of words you want to find in a text.
--> You have a piece of text (could be a paragraph, an article, or anything).
--> For each word in your list, you go through the text and check if that word appears 	anywhere.
-->If a word from your list is found in the text, you note down where it appears.
-->At the end, you get a list of words and their corresponding positions (or count) in the 	text.
