LINEAR SEARCH....

Linear search is like looking for a specific thing in a room by checking each item, one by one, until you find what you're looking for or realize it's not there.


--> Think of a room filled with items (an array with elements).
--> You're given a specific item you want to find in the room (the target element).
--> You start looking from one side of the room (the beginning of the array).
--> You check each item (element) one by one.
--> For each item, you compare it with the one you're looking for.
--> If you find the item you're looking for, you stop searching and say you found it.
--> If you haven't found it, you keep checking the next items.
--> You continue until you've checked every item in the room.
--> If you found your item, you know where it is (the index in the array). If you checked everything and didn't find it, you know it's not there.
